# vehicle-game
In "Vehicle Game," the user plays as a blue tank that must collect green experience points to level up and survive against the onslaught of red enemy tanks. When the enemies eventually destroy the user, their final experience points total is displayed as their score for that game. The game was coded entirely in Python using the PyGame module. The game window is 550x550 pixels and is non-resizeable. 
#### NOTE: If playing on a monitor with less width or height than 550x550 pixels, part of the screen will not generate.
